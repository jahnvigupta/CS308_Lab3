# Software requirements specification

The tool is expected to provide an option to user to navigate and choose any ASCII file on his system and allow him to obtain statistical data about the words and the sentences of the same.

The statistical information to be generated includes -

* Number of words
* Number of sentences
* Number of newlines
* Histogram for word frequency
* Most frequently occurring words
* Least frequently occurring words

The tool should also provide a button to navigate and select another file containing a list of keywords. The tool should show all the occurrences of the sentences in the input file containing those keywords.

## Important Considerations

The user should be able to dynamically change the file, i.e. the user may update the file, save it and close the editor. The tool must provide an option to fetch the new statistical data.
